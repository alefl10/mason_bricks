# Google Places Models

A mason brick to populate a Dart package including models to handle JSON objects from the Google Places API.

ü¶Ñ This brick uses [very_good_cli](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_cli) for the creation of the `google_places_models` package. Therefore, this package features the same directory structure, `.github` contents, and additional configurations found in a dart package created with the following command:
```
very_good create -t dart_pkg
```

Note: This brick uses `Super Initializers` for the dart models. Therefore, make sure you're using dart 2.17 on your end.


## üíª How to use

```
mason make google_places_models
```

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info
